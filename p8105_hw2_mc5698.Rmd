#Question 1
```{r}
#loading necessary packages
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
```

```{r}
nyc_t=
  read.csv(
    "/Users/nicolechen/Downloads/p8105_hw2_mc5698/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    na = c("NA",",",".")) |>
  janitor:: clean_names() |>
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2,           route3, route4, route5, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) |> 
  mutate(
    entry = 
      case_match(
        entry,
        "Yes" ~ TRUE,
        "No" ~ FALSE),
    entry = as.logical(entry)
      )
```
The dataset contains `r names(nyc_t)`. For the data cleaning, I removed unnecessary columns and convert the entry variable from character to a logical variable by using `case_match` function. The dimension of the resulting dataset is `r dim(nyc_t)`. These data are mostly tidy but we could pivot different route columns into one variable. 
```{r}

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
